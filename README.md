Processing chat data into readable format for analytics

This was a fun project and I ended up with gathering a few basic important aspects of natural language processing. My true objective with this project was to beat my friend in an argument as to who uses the word 'Lol' most in the chat conversations, so to prove my point right i wrote this code. 

Key Challenges:
- Processing the data into a readable format
- Understanding the regex functionality
